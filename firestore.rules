/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Nexus Teams application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles, shared access based on team membership for team profiles,
 * and public read access with owner-only writes for hackathon listings. It prioritizes secure authorization by
 * denormalizing authorization data (teamMemberIds) directly onto the documents being secured.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /teams/{teamId}: Stores team profile data, accessible to team members listed in the teamMemberIds array.
 * - /hackathons/{hackathonId}: Stores public hackathon listing data, writable only by authorized users (TODO: requires an ownerId field).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Read-only collections are handled with `allow get, list: if true;`.
 * - Ambiguous relationships default to strict owner-only access unless otherwise specified.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Team membership is denormalized into the 'teamMemberIds' array on the TeamProfile document, avoiding costly `get()` calls to a separate membership collection.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored in a user-specific subcollection (/users/{userId}) to ensure privacy and efficient list operations.
